## Frontend Stack

### Next.js Version

- `next`: `16.2.6`
- App Router is used through the `app/` directory.
- Project rule notes that this Next.js version may have breaking API and convention changes compared with older versions.

### React Version

- `react`: `19.2.4`
- `react-dom`: `19.2.4`

### Tailwind CSS Usage

- `tailwindcss`: `^4`
- `@tailwindcss/postcss`: `^4`
- `app/globals.css` imports Tailwind through `@import "tailwindcss";`.
- `tailwind.config.js` scans `app/**/*.{js,jsx}`, `components/**/*.{js,jsx}`, and legacy `src/**` paths.
- Styling is primarily utility-class based with some global custom classes.

### Shadcn UI Components

- `components.json` configures a shadcn-style setup:
  - Style: `base-nova`
  - RSC: enabled
  - TSX: disabled
  - CSS variables: enabled
  - Icon library: `lucide`
  - UI alias: `@/components/ui`
- Existing UI components:
  - `components/ui/button.jsx`
  - `components/ui/loader.jsx`

### Animation Libraries

- `lenis` is installed and used globally through `providers/smooth-scroll-provider.jsx`.
- `tw-animate-css` is installed.
- Custom CSS keyframes are defined in `app/globals.css`.
- No Framer Motion, GSAP, or AOS usage was found.

### State Management

- Zustand is used for client state:
  - `store/auth-store.js` manages authenticated user, token, and hydration state.
  - `lib/cart/store.js` manages persisted cart items, cart total, and item count.
- React local state is used heavily inside page-level and component-level flows.

### Form Libraries

- No dedicated form state library such as React Hook Form or Formik was found.
- Zod is used for validation:
  - `validations/auth-validation.js`
  - `validations/build-auth-form-schema.js`

### Data Fetching Libraries

- TanStack React Query is used through `providers/query-provider.jsx`.
- Axios is used for API clients:
  - `customAxios` for token-authenticated requests
  - `withoutTokenApi` for public requests
- Native `fetch` is also used in `lib/products.js` and `lib/categories.js` with `cache: "no-store"`.

### Authentication Libraries

- No third-party authentication library such as NextAuth/Auth.js was found.
- Authentication is custom token-based auth:
  - Token is stored in `localStorage` under `token`.
  - Token is also mirrored to the `ka_web_token` cookie.
  - Axios sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on authenticated requests.
  - `proxy.js` enforces a limited set of route guards.

## Design System

### Fonts

- `Geist` is loaded globally as `--font-geist-sans`.
- `Geist_Mono` is loaded globally as `--font-geist-mono`.
- Tailwind `font-display` maps to `Georgia`, `Cambria`, and `serif`.
- Tailwind `font-sans` maps to `system-ui`, `Segoe UI`, and `sans-serif`.
- `app/categories/page.js` loads `Cormorant_Garamond` for the category page heading.

### Colors

Global CSS variables in `app/globals.css`:

- Primary: `#6aab8e`
- Primary foreground: `#ffffff`
- Ring: `#6aab8e`
- Border: `#e5e7eb`
- Background: `#ffffff`
- Foreground: `#111827`
- Muted: `#f3f4f6`
- Muted foreground: `#6b7280`

Tailwind theme extensions in `tailwind.config.js`:

- Gold: `#d4a373`
- Gold light: `#e8c9a8`
- Gold dark: `#c58b2b`
- Purple: `#7B61FF`
- Purple light: `#9b85ff`
- Purple dark: `#5c47cc`
- Cream: `#2a2a2a`
- Cream muted: `#666666`

The codebase also uses many direct Tailwind grays and arbitrary hex/background values such as `bg-[#fbfaf7]`.

### Typography

- Large editorial serif headings use `font-display`, light weights, uppercase text, and tight letter spacing.
- Body and UI text use Tailwind size utilities such as `text-xs`, `text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg`, and responsive heading scales.
- Microcopy often uses uppercase tracking utilities like `tracking-[0.36em]` and `tracking-[0.45em]`.
- Some non-standard Tailwind class names appear, including `text-md` and `text-ms`.

### Spacing System

- Tailwind spacing utilities are used throughout.
- Common layout patterns:
  - `max-w-7xl`
  - `max-w-6xl`
  - `px-4 sm:px-6`
  - `py-10`, `py-12`, `py-14`, `pb-20`, `lg:py-16`
  - Grid gaps using `gap-4`, `gap-6`, and larger responsive gaps
- Some arbitrary layout utilities are used for editorial spacing and tracking.
- `max-w-8xl` appears in source and is not part of the default Tailwind scale unless added by generated/custom utilities.

### Component Styling Patterns

- Utility-first component styling with Tailwind classes.
- Global reusable classes:
  - `.glass`
  - `.header-glass`
  - `.header-menu-glass`
  - `.header-menu-dropdown`
  - `.glass-card`
  - `.btn-gold`
  - `.home-reveal`
  - `.home-scale-in`
  - `.home-scroll-stable`
  - `.home-drift`
  - `.home-shine`
  - `.hero-sale-enter`
  - `.hero-sale-img`
  - `.coupon-scallop`
  - `.coupon-scallop-bottom`
- Styling patterns include glassmorphism headers/cards, editorial serif headings, subtle hover transforms, and white/green/gold accents.

### Animations

Custom keyframes in `app/globals.css`:

- `home-fade-lift`
- `home-soft-scale`
- `home-fade-in`
- `home-drift`
- `home-shimmer`
- `hero-sale-fade-in`
- `hero-sale-image-zoom`

Reduced motion support exists for the custom home and hero sale animation classes.

### Responsive Breakpoints

Standard Tailwind breakpoints are used:

- `sm`
- `md`
- `lg`

Responsive patterns include:

- Product/category grids scaling from 2 columns to 3, 4, 5, or 6 columns.
- Mobile-first padding with larger `sm` and `lg` padding.
- Hidden or alternate desktop/mobile UI sections using breakpoint classes.

## API Integration

### API Client Configuration

API base URL is resolved from:

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`
3. `https://kayraaura.up.railway.app`

Authenticated requests use `customAxios`:

- Base URL: resolved API base
- Timeout: 15000 ms
- Header: `Content-Type: application/json`
- Adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when a token exists
- Redirects to `/login` on non-auth 401 responses

Public requests use `withoutTokenApi` with the same base URL, timeout, and content type.

## Performance Features

### Image Optimization

- `next/image` is used throughout the app.
- Remote image host patterns are configured for:
  - `kayraaura.up.railway.app`
  - `web-production-c0abc.up.railway.app`
- Some product, cart, and order images use `unoptimized`, which bypasses Next.js image optimization for those images.
- Fallback image: `/images/product-placeholder.svg`

### Lazy Loading

- Default `next/image` lazy loading applies where `priority` is not set.
- No explicit `next/dynamic` component lazy loading was found.

### Caching

- TanStack Query global defaults:
  - `staleTime: 60 * 1000`
  - `refetchOnWindowFocus: false`
- Some hooks request fresh data with settings such as `refetchOnMount: "always"`.
- Server helper fetches in `lib/products.js` and `lib/categories.js` use `cache: "no-store"`.

### Code Splitting

- Relies on Next.js route-level code splitting.
- No manual dynamic imports were found.

### Scroll Libraries

- Lenis is globally enabled.
- Options include:
  - `anchors: true`
  - `autoResize: true`
  - `autoRaf: true`
  - `allowNestedScroll: true`
  - `lerp: 0.08`
  - `overscroll: false`
  - `smoothWheel: true`
  - `touchMultiplier: 1.15`
  - `wheelMultiplier: 0.9`
- Elements with `data-lenis-prevent` are excluded from Lenis handling.

### Animation Libraries

- Lenis for smooth scrolling.
- `tw-animate-css` installed.
- Custom CSS animations in `app/globals.css`.

## Current Issues

### Broken Routes

- `APP_ROUTES.COLLECTIONS` points to `/collections`, and the header references collections, but no `app/collections/page.js` route was found.
- Auth route constants reference `/reset-password`, but no `app/reset-password/page.js` route was found.
- Auth route constants reference `/verify-email`, but no `app/verify-email/page.js` route was found.
- `CategoryDetail` and category detail fetching exist, but no `/categories/[slug]` route was found.
- `proxy.js` protects `/account`, but no `/account` route was found.

### SEO Issues

- Root metadata is generic.
- Important catalog routes do not define route-specific metadata:
  - Home
  - Products
  - Product detail
  - Categories
- Product detail pages do not generate dynamic product metadata.
- No sitemap was found.
- No robots file was found.
- No canonical URL configuration was found.
- No Open Graph or Twitter metadata was found.
- No structured data/schema was found for products, breadcrumbs, organization, or website search.
- Product and category data is largely client-fetched, which may reduce crawlable HTML content for catalog pages.

### Performance Issues

- Some remote product images use `unoptimized`, bypassing Next image optimization.
- Homepage includes full-screen autoplay video content.
- Auth pages use a logo animation video.
- Product/category data often uses client-side fetching, which can increase loading time for meaningful catalog content.
- Server helper fetches use `cache: "no-store"`, preventing Next.js data caching for product and category reads.
- No manual route/component-level dynamic import strategy was found for large client flows.
- React Query Devtools are mounted in the provider; confirm production behavior during builds.

### Accessibility Issues

- Product tabs appear to reference active panels dynamically; inactive tab buttons may point to panels that are not mounted.
- Search UI is structurally mounted while hidden in some states, with `aria-hidden` behavior that should be reviewed for keyboard and screen reader interaction.
- Several icon-only or visual controls should be audited for accessible labels and focus states.
- Newsletter, review, and social auth UI appear partially visual/non-functional and should be reviewed for expected semantics and user feedback.
- Autoplay videos should be reviewed for user controls, reduced-motion expectations, and accessible alternatives.

### Additional Maintainability Issues

- Non-standard Tailwind utilities such as `text-md`, `text-ms`, and `max-w-8xl` appear in source and may be no-ops unless generated elsewhere.
- Some content is inconsistent with the jewellery storefront, such as promotional copy mentioning perfume and dollar pricing.
- Middleware protection does not include `/orders`, `/cart`, or `/payment-method`; these rely on client-side checks and API failures.
- Git status showed many untracked `.next` build artifacts, indicating generated build output exists in the working tree.
